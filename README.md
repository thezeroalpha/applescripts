# My Applescripts (and some of Doug's)
This repo contains my applescripts, I didn't want to put them in with the rest of my dotfiles because auto-installation wouldn't work as well. Also, they're Mac-only. Some of these were written by [Doug](http://dougscripts.com), I don't take credit for those.

Installation:
    * iTunes: copy contents of `iTunes/` to `~/Library/iTunes/Scripts`
    * Mail: double click the workflows to install
